## Trivia Game made with React

This was a group project developed in the [Software Development Course at Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/formacao-desenvolvimento-web). In this project we were able to catch questions and their answers from the [Open Trivia Database API](https://www.betrybe.com/formacao-desenvolvimento-web) and use React to show our users their feedback and ranking after they played the game. We also used [Gravatar](https://pt.gravatar.com/) to show the users their photo while they are playing.
